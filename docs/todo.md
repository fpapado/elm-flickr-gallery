# Further work:
  - [ ] RemoteData
  - [ ] Consider how to print separate error messages for each stage
    - [ ] "could not find user"
    - [ ] "could not load photos"
    - Maybe a higher-order function that takes the error message?
  - [ ] Similarly, how to convert/map Decode pipeline errors into human-readable ones
  - [X] CSS Grid, semi-dynamic pattern
    - [X] Grid scaling
    - [ ] CSS grid with @supports? / Fallback
  - [ ] Html lazy
  - [ ] "Deploy to now" with API key env var?
    - Would need build step
