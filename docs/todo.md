# Further work:
  - [ ] RemoteData
  - [ ] Consider how to print separate error messages for each stage
    - [ ] "could not find user"
    - [ ] "could not load photos"
    - Maybe a higher-order function that takes the error message?
  - [ ] Similarly, how to convert/map Decode pipeline errors into human-readable ones
  - [ ] CSS grid with @supports?
    - [ ] Scale Flexbox on Smaller devices
